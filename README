Plugin to handle form submission on an offline page (cached with manifest for example, or basically just for someone who lost connectivity during his submission).

Functionnalities :
- Only supports browsers with window.navigator.onLine
- Uses localStorage to store data sent offline
- For sites using cache:manifest, replace form values with data submitted previously until they are sent back to the server

Usage examples :
$('form').offlineForm();

$('form').bind('dataSubmitted', function(e) {
    console.log(this);
    alert('Data submitted !');
}).bind('formValidated', function(e) {
    console.log(this);
    alert('Data stored !');
}).offlineForm({
    dataSubmittedEvent: 'dataSubmitted',
    offlineSubmitEvent: 'formValidated'
});
